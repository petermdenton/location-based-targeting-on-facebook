This script allows you to create a a set of 'adsets' on Facebook/Instagram to target companies based on their corporate address, identified by their URL.

Why would I want such a script?
By using location targeting, I can systemtically run ads to a company, based on their location as part of my marketing campaigns.

What do I need to run this script?
- This script uses Python 3.
- You will need an access token from Facebook that allows you to manage your ad campaigns. You can get this directly from Facebook's Access Token tool, available here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens/
- You will need a campaign ID from Facebook where you want your adsets to live.
- You will need a ClearBit API key.

Why does your code not look awesome?
I am not an egnineer, just a lowly, technically curious marketer.
